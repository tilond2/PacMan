/*****************************************************************************
 * IMPORTANT NOTES - PLEASE READ
 * 
 * This is where all the code needed for the Ghost AI goes. There should not
 * be any other place in the code that needs your attention.
 * 
 * There are several sets of variables set up below for you to use. Some of
 * those settings will do much to determine how the ghost behaves. You don't
 * have to use this if you have some other approach in mind. Other variables
 * are simply things you will find useful, and I am declaring them for you
 * so you don't have to.
 * 
 * If you need to add additional logic for a specific ghost, you can use the
 * variable ghostID, which is set to 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the ghost.
 * 
 * Similarly, set ghostID=ORIGINAL when the ghosts are doing the "original" 
 * PacMan ghost behavior, and to CUSTOM for the new behavior that you supply. 
 * Use ghostID and ghostMode in the Update() method to control all this.
 * 
 * You could if you wanted to, create four separate ghost AI modules, one per
 * ghost, instead. If so, call them something like BlinkyAI, PinkyAI, etc.,
 * and bind them to the correct ghost prefabs.
 * 
 * Finally there are a couple of utility routines at the end.
 * 
 * Please note that this implementation of PacMan is not entirely bug-free.
 * For example, player does not get a new screenful of dots once all the
 * current dots are consumed. There are also some issues with the sound 
 * effects. By all means, fix these bugs if you like.
